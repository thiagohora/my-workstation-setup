# my-workstation-setup

This is just a simple script to automate the initial setup of my Fedora workstation. Here you will find some the main tools for a *Java/Javascript* developer, to be clear you won't find here specific tools or frameworks for specific projects, just the basic to start developing faster.

Here you will find a list with the tools that are going to be installed.

- Java 11
- Docker CE
- Idea Intelij
- Nodejs
- Microsoft Visual Code
- Terminator
- Chromium Webbrowser
- Spring-boot CLI
- Git script to show current branch on terminal

Maybe when you run this script the urls used to install the tools may be out of date, if you get problems with this, you can update the variables of the script with the new urls.
